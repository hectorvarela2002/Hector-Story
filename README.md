# Hector-Story
An amazing story about Hector
The day was like any other.
I woke up, ready to tackle the day head on.
Then the most unexplainable thing happened.
I was not prepared for the events that came next...
I woke up to the sound of a meteor soaring across the sky.
It sounded like a missile.
It was the worst sound I've ever heard.
I look out of my window only to see the worst possible sight.
